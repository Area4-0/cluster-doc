# How to request access to the platform

To get access to the platform you need to perform these operations:

* Request access to the VPN
* Request access to the cluster

## Request access to the VPN

### - `unibo` credential users

If you are owner of a `unibo` credential you can directly request access to the VPN by sending an email to `ciro.barbone@unibo.it`. 
When you will be granted access you will receive an email with the instructions to connect to the VPN.

Then, you can access the Portainer dashboard at [http://clusters.almaai.unibo.it](http://clusters.almaai.unibo.it), where you can login with your `unibo` credential and run your experiments.

### - `studio.unibo` credential users

If you have a `studio.unibo` account, you must contact your supervisor that will request access to the VPN for you. 
When you will be granted access you will receive an email with the instructions to connect to the VPN.

You'll not be able to directly access the Portainer Dashboard with your credential, your supervisor will provide you with a container on which you'll be able to access through its web service (or ssh service, depending on the container configuration).
  
## Request access to the cluster

After you are granted to use the VPN, you can access the Portainer dashboard at [http://clusters.almaai.unibo.it](http://clusters.almaai.unibo.it), however, you will not be able to see any cluster.
To get access to the cluster you need to fill out the following form: https://forms.office.com/e/7FQvnH7ntj. ??????
Cluster administrators will give you permission to access the appropriate cluster and will give you a persistent volume on which to save your experiments' results.
